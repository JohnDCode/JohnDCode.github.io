This past month, I set out to learn (according to Stack Overflow's developer survey) the "most loved" programming language, Rust. This proved to be a rather daunting task, but after reading up on the language and then playing around with its various unique features, I decided to develop a project I had originally envisioned a few months prior. I created a cross-platform [CLI tool](https://github.com/JohnDCode/JDA-CLI-Options-Pricer-Publish) that allows users to instantly calculate fair prices for live financial options contracts.
