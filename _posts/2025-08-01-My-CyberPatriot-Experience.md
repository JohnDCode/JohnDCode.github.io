### Preface

Before I begin, I recognize that there have been previous blog posts and discussions on CyberPatriot from retired competitors, particularly the one by former CyberAegis captain Akshay. However, I hope to take a bit of a different approach in my reflection on the competition. Contrary to some of the other posts, I hope to focus less on my general approach to the competition and emphasize my specific experiences and strategies. I competed in CyberPatriot for a relatively short amount of time with an extremely small organization and as such, I hope to provide a bit of a unique perspective on the competition.

### My Accalades

First, I would like to establish my credibility to speak on the competition.

For anyone unfamiliar with the CyberPatriot online community, I'm John (better known online as St3wart). I come from the infamous team '1984'. 

I was originally introduced to CyberPatriot during my sophomore year of high school (CP season 15, 2022-2023), and competed through my senior year (CP season 17, 2024-2025). I specialized in Windows security and tackled the Windows boxes for each of the 12 virtual rounds I competed in. In each of my 3 seasons, my team qualified for the Platinum Open division and won the Nevada State Championship. I also made a single trip to the national finals in Washington D.C (CP 15).

In my final round of competition, CP 17 Platinum Semifinals, my cumulative Windows scores placed 7th in the competition. I am extremely proud of this statistic, as I was tasked with securing both the Windows 11 box and the Windows Server 22 box while also assisting in other challenges. This is a task typically dedicated to 2-3 competitors, rather than a single individual.

### My Journey

As I mentioned previously, I was originally introduced to CyberPatriot in my sophmore year.
