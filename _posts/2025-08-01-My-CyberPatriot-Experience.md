### Preface

Before I begin, I recognize that there have been previous blog posts and discussions on CyberPatriot from retired competitors, particularly the one by former CyberAegis captain Akshay. However, I hope to take a bit of a different approach in my reflection on the competition. Contrary to some of the other posts, I hope to focus less on my general approach to the competition and instead emphasize my specific experiences and strategies. I competed in CyberPatriot for a relatively short amount of time with an extremely small organization and as such, I hope to provide a bit of a unique perspective on the competition.

### My Accalades

First, I would like to establish my credibility to speak on the competition.

For anyone unfamiliar with the CyberPatriot online community, I'm John (better known online as St3wart). I come from the infamous team '1984'. 

I was originally introduced to CyberPatriot during my sophomore year of high school (CP season 15, 2022-2023), and competed through my senior year (CP season 17, 2024-2025). I specialized in Windows security and tackled the Windows boxes for each of the 12 virtual rounds I competed in. In each of my 3 seasons, my team qualified for the Platinum Open division and won the Nevada State Championship. I also made a single trip to the national finals in Washington D.C (CP 15).

In my final round of competition, CP 17 Platinum Semifinals, my cumulative Windows scores placed 7th in the competition. I am extremely proud of this statistic, as I was tasked with securing both the Windows 11 box and the Windows Server 22 box while also assisting in other challenges. This is a task typically dedicated to 2-3 competitors, rather than a single individual.

### My Journey

I competed in CyberPatriot via my high school, Faith Lutheran High School (Las Vegas, NV). Competing with this particular high school was extremely difficult. In my first 2 years of competing, our coach was not employed full time by the school and only came to the school for CyberPatriot meetings. In my final year, we had a science teacher act as a temporary coach. Our team oftentimes had difficulty receiving competition information or basic resources from our coaches. Our club and accomplishments were also never recognized by the school or administration. The program was also extremely small, with there being less than 10 kids enrolled in the program during my final year. We had difficulty just getting 5 kids with basic technical skills to fill the roster for a single team. Nonetheless, the goal each year was the same, to make it to the national finals in D.C. However, my unique combination of small program and large goals led to a rather interesting three year journey.


#### CP 15

As I mentioned previously, I was originally introduced to CyberPatriot during my sophomore year of high school. With little technical experience, I was a bit lost. As I talked to some fellow competitors in preparation for the season, I was told that I would be tasked with finding vulnerabilities within images. Me, having absolutely no idea what a virtual machine was, thought that these "images" were in reference to actual graphical images. This led to a rather steep learning curve during my first year. 

After joining the CyberPatriot club, I was told that there was an absence of Windows specialists. In CyberPatriot, there are 3 main areas of competition: Cisco, Linux, and Windows. Our team already had competitors prepared to take on Linux and Cisco, but none for Windows. As such, I decided to fill this role. After my performance in tryouts (the practice rounds and the official round 1), I was selected to be on the pseudo "Varsity" team. 

During CP 15, our team was placed into the Platinum division after our R1/R2 performances. We then won the Nevada State Championships during R3 and moved on to semifinals (R4). Through our performance in semifinals, we were able to secure a spot in the national finals (of which only the top 12 teams from the US & Canada are invited).

#### CP 16

In my second season, I entered with a bit more knowledge. However, this year our team suffered large administrative issues. Most of our team had graduated, and as such, our coach blatantly told us that he did not want us to work towards making the national finals. He removed our top Linux competitor and refused to add other new, young, talented competitors to the team.

Despite these issues, our team still maintained our position as the top team in the region, being placed in the Platinum division, winning the state championship, and proceeding to semifinals. However, in the semifinals, our team performed extremely poorly. It was the lowest I placed in any round of CyberPatriot. While we had faint dreams of somehow turning the team around and making a second straight national finals appearance, the experiences of the season had prepared us for this disappointment. 

#### CP 17

In my final season, I came back reinvigorated. Over the summer, I developed "St3wart", a collection of security scripts I had designed to semi automate the securing of Windows machines. While St3wart was designed for CyberPatriot, it was configurable to be able to secure almost any enterprise Windows system. This, in combination with a new team, led to a rather strong series of performances. 

However, in the semifinals, our team fell prey to a common mistake many teams in CyberPatriot face. In the final round before the national finals, the weighting of other sponsored challenges lead to the main challenge, the images, being worth significantly less points relative to the total amount of available points. Due to our team having only 2 main competitors, we were overwhelmed in the semifinals. Despite being top 5 in image scores, our scores in the other challenges pushed us out of the top 12, denying us a trip to the national finals and concluding my 3 year journey.
