Hi, my name is JohnDavid Abe.












### Education

#### Georgia Tech

I am currently pursuing my BS in Computer Science with a focus in Intelligence and Modeling/Simulation, alongside an additional BS in Mathematics, both at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta, GA, USA). I chose Georgia Tech for its extensive extracurricular opportunities and hands-on learning style. Some of my current coursework includes classes on Data Structures & Algorithms (CS 1332), Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science (CS 2050), and Linear Algebra with an emphasis on Vector Space (MATH 1564). 

#### Faith Lutheran High School

I graduated from Faith Lutheran High School in Las Vegas, NV with a 4.0 GPA. In my 4 years of high school, I took a wide range of challenging courses from AP Chemistry and AP Computer Science to AP English Literature. This courseload prepared me for college and gave me the foundational knowledge for a career in computer science.



### Technical Skills

I am proficient in several programming languages, including (but not limited to), C++, Java, and Python. I believe in learning by doing, and as such, I've completed several projects utilizing multiple languages and frameworks. I am also comfortable using essential technologies and frameworks, such as Docker, React, SQL, and low-level systems development. I further developed and practiced these skills in capture the flag (CTF), robotics, and other various competitions. Currently, I am looking to expand my skillset by studying the basics of AWS. 



### Professional Experience

#### Part-Time Positions

In the last 3 years, I have worked at Unified Compliance (Network Frontiers) as an AI Researcher and at Ultimate Info Services as a Web Developer. At Unified Compliance, I worked on research regarding emerging technologies, such as data mining regulations for machine learning models. I also assisted in the publication of such research papers. At Ultimate Info Services, I worked on various clients WordPress websites, enhancing my knowledge of end-to-end development.

#### CJKT Robotics

From January of 2023 to May of 2025, I was the founding and managing partner of a robotics nonprofit organization, the CJKT Robotics Coalition. In my two-and-a-half-year long tenure at the nonprofit, I worked to mentor and teach Title I students the basics of mechanical design, robotics programming, and competition strategy. My team and I also represented the nonprofit in several robotics competitions, such as the international Vex Robotics World Championships.



### Career Aspirations

I am passionate about quantitative development and strive to work in the finance industry, such that I can combine my love of computer science with my passion for math and finance. I am *currently looking* for work opportunities to apply my skills in software development, algorithmic trading, machine learning, and/or financial software engineering.
