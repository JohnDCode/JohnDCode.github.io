Hi, my name is JohnDavid Abe.


### Education


#### Georgia Tech

I am currently pursuing my BS in Computer Science with a focus in Intelligence and Modeling/Simulation, alongside an additional BS in Mathematics, both at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta, GA, USA). I chose Georgia Tech for its extensive extracurricular opportunities and hands-on learning style. Some of my current coursework includes classes on Data Structures & Algorithms (CS 1332), Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science (CS 2050), and Linear Algebra with an emphasis on Vector Space (MATH 1564). 


#### Faith Lutheran High School

I graduated from Faith Lutheran High School in Las Vegas, NV with a 4.0 GPA. In my 4 years of high school, I took a wide range of challenging courses from AP Chemistry and AP Computer Science to AP English Literature. This courseload prepared me for college and gave me the foundational knowledge for a career in computer science.
