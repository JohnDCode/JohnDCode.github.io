### Vision

In writing this sermon, I envision a world where I'm presenting this sermon to a church as a pastor. Considering I am currently studying computer science, my life trajectory would have to change quite a bit for me to end up here. Thus, I would open the sermon describing this extreme career shift, establishing me with the credibility to speak on the dynamicness and fragility of the world we inhabit. However, given the way the world is moving, I have no idea where I am going to be in 6 months, nonetheless what my career will look like in 5 years. So perhaps this theoretical possibility isn't so improbable after all.

<br />

### Motivation

If we think of what the world generally refers to as "progress" as a graph over time, the second derivative of this function would certainly be positive. In other words, the pace of "progress" has increased over time. In the age of AI and robotics, this has become incredibly apparent to me. There were over 300 years between the invention of the printing press and the automatic loom. Nowadays, we commonly cure diseases and make discoveries in Physics. The issue? Is that it's increasingly hard to navigate such a dynamic world. The world is changing, fast. So how do we as Christians manage this?

<br />

### The Woe of the World

Let's start with the basics. The world is sinful. The world has been burdened by sin. God created the world perfect and without sin. However, the actions of man introduced sin to such a perfect creation.

> "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned..." (Romans 5:12 ESV).

Sin implies separation. By being sinful, we miss the mark set by the law. Thus, sin has caused the world, in some sense, to be separated from God, by missing that mark.

<br />

### Christ

Well you know who didn't miss that mark? Christ!

> "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin..." (2 Corinthians 5:21).

Christ was perfect. Despite taking on human flesh and experiencing human emotion and temptation, he was sinless. Now consider this.

> "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever" (Hebrew 13:8).

So, Christ is unchanging. Christ is also perfect and sinless. However, the world is sinful. This implies that the world, as a result of its corruption and sin, is not unchanging (in other words, dynamic). This is part of the burden that creation experiences as a result of sin: an uncertain and dynamic world. Our sin has removed us from the staticness of God, and we woe in such sin.

<br />

### The World Changes, Christ Does Not

So now back to the fact that Christ doesn't change. In thinking about how to best illustrate this glorious truth, I would like to propose the following.

How secure do you find yourself in your chosen field / career / current job? Do you have, with complete and 100% certainty, that your job is secure, forever? Once again, I'm a CS kid. So I think about the consecutive rounds of layoffs at Amazon. Parents who woke up to take care of children to see a severance email. Spouses who went to work only for their keycard not to work. Historically, working at such large corporations has been considered a fantastic way to maintain job security. In fact, I personally know several talented students who chose "big tech" jobs over emerging startups in pursuit of job security. Those assurances clearly did not hold true for those Amazonians in the last few months.

Similarly, consider your health. Even for those who consistently exercise and make a concerted effort to eat well. Is there absolutely no plausible world where the day of a routine checkup becomes the day your whole world changes?

The obvious answer to both of these ponderations, is no. In this life, diligent workers are fired, healthy individuals get sick. Things can change. Things are uncertain.

Now consider this. At any point, have you ever sat down to pray, started with "Dear Lord", and heard God tell you to go away? That today he didn't want to hear his beloved child? Or have you ever fallen, and confessed your sin on your knees and asked for the sake of God's only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to have mercy, has God said, "not today"? That he was all done with this whole forgiveness thing? By no means!

This is so incredibly beautiful. Not only is God perfect in being loving, just, powerful, knowing, and so much more, but these qualities of his remain unchanged throughout time. From Abraham to Jacob, the same God.

> "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Matthew 22:32).

However, in today's world, being static is often given a negative connotation. It refers to an inability to adapt to this dynamic world. In other words, an ability to conform to the world.

> "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect" (Romans 12:2).

Here, Paul preaches something contrary to the notion of the world. He says to not be conformed to the world, and to seek God. The stronghold, pillar, that is God.

<br />

### Response

So now we have collected a bit of reassurance. Despite the sin of the world and the fact that the world is ever changing, God is not. But if you are reading this, you are still in this world. So how do we respond?

I'd like to begin with one of my favorite verses from scripture.

> "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" (Matthew 6:19-21).

To illustrate this, I would once again like to pose another series of questions.

How do you react when you have a rough day at work? As an 18 year old I have yet to know what a bad day in corporate America looks like, but I can imagine this being something like your boss assigning you a large project at 3 pm on a Friday or something of the sort.

Or even the small things. How do you react when someone cuts you off in traffic?

Or even, how do you react when your favorite sports team loses a large game?

The average individual is likely currently thinking about their last road rage incident, or the shouts at the TV from a previous Sunday.

Now consider, how do you react when you wake up late for church? When you haven't prayed. When you didn't read your Bible. Did you even notice? Or did your life simply continue.

This was something I posed to my girlfriend a few months ago. I reflected on how a bad grade on a test, a missed internship opportunity, or in high school, a rejection letter from a prestigious college, could absolutely devastate me. It troubled me that the things of this world had such power over me.

These considerations become even more concerning when we remember what this message is about. Connecting these ideas, it raises an important question. Why would we ever want to store up our treasures in such an uncertain and dynamic place? The God of the universe presents a constant, loving relationship, yet we resort to placing our eggs into a basket that constantly shakes and moves and tilts upside down.

I believe this initial examination, and an effort to correct, are the starting point of how to store up treasures in heaven.

<br />

### Anxiety

An unfortunate aspect of the dynamicness of this world is the resulting anxiety. I believe as humans, we long for our creator. We long for the comfort of staticness. Now some people may call this being a creature of habit, like Murray Goldberg (if you know you know). So anyways, we long to be static. But the world doesn't allow that, so we worry because we don't know what the future will bring. It's inherently uncertain.

> "Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on...Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious about itself" (Matthew 6:25-34).

During Jesus's iconic Sermon on the Mount, Christ firmly commands us to not worry. Period. This raises another important aspect of responding to God's staticness in how we deal with anxiety.

However, I can sympathize with the overthinker. The predictor. I've spent the majority of my life being extremely goal-oriented, so for me, anxiety would manifest in the form of competitiveness. The fact that I didn't know if I would win or accomplish at the next stage pushed me to work even harder to ensure that I would. So allow me to offer what has been of comfort to myself.

Before anyone reading this was born, Christ, God incarnate, died for you. God looked through the window of time, saw you, your shortcomings, your sin. All of you. Yet he still loved you enough to die on the cross for you. He then rose again, defeating sin, death, and the devil, saving you.

How much more could we ask for? How relevant is the future if God has already saved you? How relevant is the score on my next computer architecture exam if God has already saved me? Not to say it doesn't matter, but it is certainly no longer worth my worry, given all God has already done for me.

Furthermore, God did more than just save me. He still clothes, feeds, and provides for me.

> "Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?" (Matthew 6:26).

> "If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!" (Matthew 7:11).

Then, even when I was sinful and I turned my back on God, he still calls me home and calls me his son. His forgiveness never changes.

I don't know how I can simultaneously believe this with all my heart, and still worry about my next exam score. My anxiety melts away, as I examine how because God never changes, and because God is so good, it really makes those other things seem all the less relevant.  We can continue to worry about the dynamic nature of the future, concerned with what will happen, but why? The most important part, God, is not at any risk of changing, so there is no need to worry.

<br />

### Gospel

Finally, I think every good message should close with a reminder of the gospel. Yes, we, as a part of creation, woe in sin and the dynamicness of the world. And yes, we can learn to navigate and follow Christ despite the state of that world. However, it is important to remember what God promises us for the future.

> "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away" (Revelation 21:4).

We, as followers of Christ, are promised redemption. Christ defeated sin when he rose again. And because of that, I will never have to worry.

Amen!
